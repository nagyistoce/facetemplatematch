The aim of this project is to contribute to the field of artificial intelligence of computer science community. This program performs face recognition using template matching on ORL face database. Many features are required for face recognition including but not limited to:

  1. An algorithm extracting unique feature of a face
  1. Another algorithm sophisticate enough to correctly categorize the same face using the extracted unique feature from the face

The program is written as native CPython with numpy and scipy packages. (See the Requirements in GettingStarted paged)

### Recommended Use ###

This program is functioning as it is but many parts of the programs are work in progress and/or subject to change. Recommended use of this program is to see how scientific computing focused on pattern recognition algorithms is performed using python with numpy+scipy package.

### Getting Started ###

Check out GettingStarted page to use the program.

### Work In Progress ###
  * Face Detector (completed)
  * Eye Detector (completed)
  * Implementation of Curvelet
